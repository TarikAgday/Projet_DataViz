        <br><b> MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER 2019 SEASON ANALYSIS<BR><BR>BUDGETS BY TEAMS</b>
         24 teams evenly spread in the West
         and Eastern conference were fighting
         for the 14 playoffs spots.

         <br><br> This first visualization demonstrates the budget of teams
            and their standings. The average budget per team was 12.3M$.
            <br><br>While the general standing affects playoffs access, the main
            objective of teams is not to be the best team in the ranking but
            ultimately to win the playoffs.
            The button in the legend switches between the general rankings
            and the playoffs' standings.
            The graph is separated by 4
            rectangles. The green and light yellow rectangle encompasses the teams that made
            the playoffs
            and had respectively a budget below and over
            the average while the red and darker yellow reactangle represents teams
            that did not qualify for the playoffs.

        <b>SALARIES BY AGE GROUPS</b>
        <br><br>
        The second graph is a heatmap of the
        salaries by group ages. In its early years, most of the best players
        of the MLS used to be at the end of the career
        (around 33-35 years old). However, the average age of the league
        was 25,95 years old in 2019, which is relatively young compared to
        the English Premier League who attracts most of the best players
        (27,3 years old). Also, this graph shows us a tendance to
        invest more money on young players.
