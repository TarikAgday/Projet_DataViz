        <BR><b style="color: #003366; font-family: 'Georgia';">BUDGETS BY TEAMS</b><BR><BR>
         24 teams evenly spread in the West
         and Eastern conference were fighting
         for the 14 playoffs spots.

         <br><br> This first visualization demonstrates the budget of teams
            and their standings. The average budget per team was 12.3M$.
            <br><br>While the general standing affects playoffs access, the main
            objective of teams is not to be the best team in the ranking but
            ultimately to win the playoffs.
            The button in the legend switches between the general rankings
            and the playoffs' standings.
            The graph is separated by 4
            rectangles. The green and light yellow rectangle encompasses the teams that made
            the playoffs
            and had respectively a budget below and over
            the average while the red and darker yellow reactangle represents teams
            that did not qualify for the playoffs.

        <br><br>
        The second graph is a heatmap of the
        salaries by group ages. In its early years, most of the best players
        of the MLS used to be at the end of the career
        (around 33-35 years old). However, the average age of the league
        was 25,95 years old in 2019, which is relatively young compared to
        the English Premier League who attracts most of the best players
        (27,3 years old). Also, this graph shows us a tendance to
        invest more money on young players.

        <b style="color: #003366; font-family: 'Georgia';">MINUTES PLAYED </b><br><br>
        Coaches have different approaches on the use of their rosters.
        Some rely on a kernel of key players while others prefer to
        alternate their starting players, which garanties a more distributed amount of minutes played amoung
        the players. This graph's intention is to illustrate the importance of each players in their respective teams.

    <div class="inner-text text4" style="top: 350vh; width:600px; text-align:justify; color:black; font: 25px Lora";>
        <b style="color: #003366; font-family: 'Georgia';">TEAMS' BUDGET DISPERSION </b><br><br>
        As we saw in the first graph, teams' budgets vary from one team to another. However, this graph shows us
        on how much is spent on each position. we also need to consider that teams generally have 3 goalkeepers,
        whilst the average number of defenders, midfielders and forwards are respectively 11, 8 and 6. Considerinf this average, we
        can clearily see a bigger investment of teams' on offensive players (biggest part of budget for lower number of players).

        This graph presents the goals scored and conceided by every teams.
        <br><br> It helps us understand teams' offensive and defensive ultimate performance.
        Some coaches focus more on their offense while others on their defense and
        this visualization demonstrates how both approach can lead to a good performance.
